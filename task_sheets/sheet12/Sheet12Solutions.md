# Sheet 12 Solutions

### Task 6
The first site I looked up was one comparing openMP and MPI. They use different memory models at times, and this can lead to overhead for different parts of the parallel computing. In comparing OpenMP to OpenAcc it almost seemed like comparing c to python. OpenMp is like c, it puts all the control in the hands of the prgramer, and OpenAcc does more 'under hood' so to speak, so which one you use will depend on the level of control that you need. They also do run differently ongpu's verse regular cores, and most sites seemed to put OpenACC on the top of the list when computing cores.
