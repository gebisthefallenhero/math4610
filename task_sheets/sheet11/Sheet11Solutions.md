# Sheet 11 Solutions

### Task 6
The first thing that came up is that OpenMP is used heavily in scientific computing especially in finite element computing. Some matlab open source packages also use open MP as matlab is written in C. Additionally government research institutions like national labs also use open mp. They use it to the point that I was able to find tutorials that they put together for open mp.
